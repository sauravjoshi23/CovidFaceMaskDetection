## About The Project

There are many great FaceMask Detection code available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I wanted to create a website using Django and on that website kind of show how the application works. So I made a deep learning model in order to perfrom face mask detection on the website instead of running it locally on jupyter notebook.

Here's why:
* Python was the chosen language and Django was used for backend purpose
* HTML, CSS was used for frontend purpose
* Deep Learning for performing operations on the model and acts like a brain for the whole system

### Built With
* Python
* Django
* Deep Learning
* HTML and CSS
